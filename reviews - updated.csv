A co worker of mine showed me his app and it looks like the app in the updated photos with the functionality of bill pay and multiple device recognition, however the app I am currently using (which came from the App Store on the phone) looks completely different and has several spelling errors. Every time I try to look up device information I get a flashing circle and then an error message that the app is unable to process my request. It seems this app is made for postpaid customers who are spending tons of money on the service and us prepay customers are getting the bare minimum that rarely works and offers no security or peace of mind in security."

It has been nothing but issue after issue. I don’t remember why but 3 years ago they made me get a new line in order to fix an issue.
My current issue started last year. I lost my phone, it was gone. Issue wanted nearly 400 to replace it, I couldn’t do that at the time. They suggested and talked me into getting a new phone by adding another line to my account. I would pay for both lines for a year, then once my old phone was paid off, I could cancel that line. Current time, beginning of August. I go in to do that,only to find out that they for some reason, they switched the phone numbers and phones. They wanted me to pay off the rest of my current phone in order to remove the added line. Then it was, we will switch your phone number and phones around so that you can close the phone that’s paid off. I’ve been in and out of the store. On the phone with several different agents and different times. I’ve tried to get them to fix it through chat. Still not fixed! 2 months still not fixed. Plus my bill normally is around 200, I was expected around 400 but they took 600 from my account. I go into my Verizon today and they are trying to charge me nearly 400 again this month. And nothing has been fixed on my account. So I got onto my Verizon again…I told them I was giving them one more shot to get it fixed, if they didn’t get in done I was going to AT&T.
After an hour my Verizon stopped working  and I could no longer login to my Verizon and my hotspot no longer worked. 
Guess I’ll be going to AT&T during my lunch break today."

You can manage virtually anything that has to do with your Verizon account including seamlessly ordering new devices. Setting up payment plans on your bill or new devices is also effortless. Adding new lines. Adding credit/debit cards and bank accounts. Getting support for your devices and lines. Checking how much you may owe on devices or when you are eligible for an upgrade. It’s endless how much power it puts in your hand. So helpful. This app is essential to anyone that has a Verizon Wireless account.

When you have 5 phones and you can’t see the functions and details of the lines.

TIME TO HIRE NEW PROGRAMMERS. 
MY ADVICE - Re-Hire the people you fired because they were OLD (meaning COMPETENT). Or TRASH THE AI THAT YOU IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE IT DIDN’T INCLUDE THE FUNCTIONS YOUR CUSTOMERS ACTUALLY USE!!!!!!
Or - Just re-install the previous App before you geniuses screwed it up so it doesn’t function or include the information customers need anymore."

The front screen now has everything that I would need at a glance to take a look at. Plus you’re shopping on there. I can buy video game consoles and video games is an added plus to your app where you can’t get these in your brick and mortar stores. I’ve been with Verizon now for seven years and I’ve used every other phone company out there and by far the best customer service that I’ve ever seen out of a phone company. When I have an issue which issues to arrive from time to time I conduct myself professionally and so do the Customer Service agents with me. Keep up the great work.

I clicked the “apply now” button in the email and the my Verizon app opened. However, it took me 10 minutes to find where I could apply for the card. Then when I found it and clicked in the box to add the last four of my social, no keyboard appeared. I attempted to go to the box to add my phone number. Again, no keyboard appeared, and there was a message in red letters, telling me that the first four of my social was a required field. Thinking that perhaps my app needed to be updated, I went to the App Store and updated the app. I went back into the email and clicked on the “apply now” button. I was taken to my Verizon app once more with no apparent place to apply for the card. So I located the offer within the app and attempted everything again. Once again, no keyboard.

Also since the new update I cannot even open the Verizon app to pay the phone bills.

Contacted them again today and was told that it will be active by the end of September. They try to reassure me that this will be the last time but here’s the kicker, I was told that exact same thing multiple times regarding this. The fix from my understand is to just shut up and wait.

200085912,DTW Shak,2025-08-31T22:27:53-07:00,1,21.2.2,My very first Verizon phone showed up broken — not a good start,"I’m new to Verizon. Just signed up and ordered a brand-new iPhone through them. The moment I turned it on, I realized both cameras didn’t work. Not blurry, not glitchy — just dead. Front and back. On a phone that’s supposed to have one of the best cameras, that’s ridiculous.

When I called, Verizon told me to just send it back and wait for a replacement. Sounds simple, but in reality it means:
	•	Going without a phone right after switching carriers.
	•	Worrying my promo (no-trade-in free phone) might get messed up.
	•	Wasting time on something that should’ve worked straight out of the box.

It’s frustrating because I joined Verizon expecting better. Instead, my first experience is a headache. Apple dropped the ball too — both cameras failing on day one isn’t normal.

All I want is a smooth replacement, no risk to my deal, and some acknowledgment that this was a rare but extreme problem. Right now it feels like I’m just stuck dealing with it on my own, and that’s not a good look for welcoming a new customer."

I was a Verizon customer for only about 5–6 months and in that short time, I ended up paying over $1,000 just for Wi-Fi. Every month the bill was outrageous, sometimes $100, sometimes $200, and even $300! That is INSANE for just internet.

When I first signed up, they promised me student discounts and also said my dad’s EBT would qualify for additional discounts. But once I became a member, they didn’t help me at all. I spent hours trying to apply those discounts myself, struggling to lower the bill, but Verizon gave me no support. Before I joined, they told me everything would be fine and they would help. But the moment I became a customer, they just ignored me and kept charging me ridiculous amounts.

I must say the internet speed is good, but paying this much for Wi-Fi is absolutely crazy. Spending $200–$300 a month only on internet is not acceptable when I have other bills to cover. Their customer service is useless, their promises are empty, and the bills are nothing but a trap.

I switched last month because I couldn’t take it anymore. I will NEVER recommend Verizon to anyone. Save yourself the frustration, stress, and money."

Two Verizon reps came to my home and offered me internet service. I told them I currently pay $65/month with AT&T for 50 Mbps. They laughed and said, “Oh man, that’s way too much for such slow speed. We can give you 300 Mbps for $85 – but right now we have a promotion, and you’ll only pay $45. Not just temporarily, but locked in for 4 years!”

That sounded like a great deal, so I signed up. Today I received the equipment, installed it, and when I logged into my account – surprise – the plan was $85, not $45.

I called Verizon immediately thinking it was just a mistake. Instead, the rep told me there was no error, the plan is indeed $85, but they can “generously” give me a $10 discount. What a joke. When I asked if it was normal for their salespeople to blatantly lie and trick customers, the rep hung up on me.

This was nothing but fraud and deception. Verizon’s door-to-door salespeople lied to my face, and customer service didn’t care at all.

I’m writing this review to warn others: stay away from Verizon unless you enjoy being scammed and disrespected."

Tried to set up internet and was told on the phone during set up autopay before billing (10 dollars off with autopay). It did not work. We tried to do card and the bank itself. He then prompted me to download the app and set up auto pay there. The app says that that feature is down and I have to contact someone. Called customer service and was on held for an hour. Never answered. Called back the guy who set me up. Helpless. He said this tech issue has been ongoing. How convenient for Verizon to have a on going tech issues that results in an additional charge to their customers. I’ve tried for multiple days. Issues hasn’t been fixed. I tried the text bot service— worst customer service I’ve ever seen…. It got to the point where I was just like ok, let me just cancel before I’m officially billed as I have not even reviewed the equipment yet. They kept trying to convince me not to cancel….. “Oh you want to cancel, give me a few moments” *10 minutes later* “You will be billed 49.99” No- I want to cancel. They kept sending me to different agents for the same conversation. Over and over and over. I want to cancel without being charged for any equipment or internet that I didn’t even get to use. I wanted to cancel because how many months will it take to fix this ongoing issue before I can just get the 10 dollars off. It’s just the principle. At this point, multiple higher ups must know this issue exists, and allows it to continue. Because they profit from this “error.”"

I separated from another group plan and find that when I was setting up my separate account that Verizon thinks my email should be on a separate account from my phone number. I tried calling to get this fixed but my number and email are still separate after the person on the phone assured me I was good. I can log into the account with my emails, but it isn’t linked to my phone. If I log into the account that has my phone number, I am asked to fill in my info, but holy cow, my email is taken! 
On top of that, I’m now paying $110 for monthly service for a single person. Today I received a message telling me they’d give me a whole $10 off my bill! Guess who’s looking for a new provider…
Oh! I guess we could talk about the app some more. Since its whole purpose seems to be to give the user the runaround, I’m not overly interested in giving it praise. It’s like XM radio all over again."

I’ve been with Verizon for 10+ years and the cellular service is fine but shame on you if you go to a Verizon store that is not a home office store. Why are these stores a thing if turning in a trade in there means the device is lost and I owe $1300? I lost 4 hours of my life just to not resolve the issue; the least I can do is leave a review questioning why the app is rated so highly when it feels like it was made in the 90’s on dial up internet while your big brother is trying to call his highschool sweetheart after your parents went to bed because he just hit puberty.

The person that initially set up my account misspelled my name despite me telling it to her and spelling it multiple times, and then I was told that they could not update it, because the account was not finalized. So I was getting flagged for things not being correct, and could not get my phone sent to me. Since I moved, and my state updates address changes in the system, and I don’t have a new I.D., I don’t even have one to take a picture of to send, even if I wanted to. So they won’t ship my phone, and are just sitting on the SIM cards as well, despite me providing them all of the detailed information they were asking for, but it wasn’t enough for them.

I’ve had cable for decades and have never experienced anything this bad. The amount of time wasted just to watch live TV or stream a channel is absurd. Verizon clearly rushed this out without testing it properly, and paying customers are now stuck dealing with their mess.

Do yourself a favor: NEVER get Verizon Fios TV."

We called customer service, got transferred around forever, and eventually spoke with the networking/addressing department. They said they fixed everything in the system and that we should be able to get verified. But when we got sent back to the verification team, they told us there was nothing they could do and wouldn’t even tell us why.

It’s absolutely ridiculous. I’ll never buy a phone from Verizon again. Their customer service is garbage — two hours on the phone and not a single real solution. We spent all that money for nothing."

Charge me for that router that don’t work as an excusable. I have nothing good to say about the way you handled. Your business with the Internet.
I think it’s a disgrace to ruin Verizon name because I used to think your name was the best in the marketplace I can’t in good face. Give you any stars until you earn them. You haven’t earned one star in my book. For 10 years are you doing is took my money with no service now it’s your turn. To prove yourself to me I prove myself over the past 10 years. I had Internet service with you for 2 1/2 three years and never could use it but I paid for it on all you can say is we’ll fix it. I even paid extra for insurance to make it right.

Now, especially the past few months, I don’t receive many calls, frequently get dropped calls and when I go to call someone many times I have to call two or three times for it to go through. What changed? This time that I am with Verizon I bought a phone on a payment plan… are my issues because they know I am locked in for another couple of years? Or has Verizon signals really dropped that low?
One of the perks for signing up for everything I did was free Disney+ for a year… well I dropped that… because I always had to sign in and verify it was me… it would say on my tv I was in different cities, some I had never even heard of (Assuming that was where my signal was coming from). Anyway Disney+ decided I had used up my loggings… on the same three tvs. So what’s the point in keeping something you can’t watch anyway.

My phone is constantly several bars lower than I’m accustomed to. I live in the middle of nowhere, so I rely on my hotspot for my WiFi. I’m trying to watch TV and it’s jerky all the time, or it’ll stop and just have to wait to catch up. My previous service never did that. This is even with a phone signal booster in my truck and in the house. 

GOOD GRIEF. This is horrible. 

Once you realize the setup, you’ll come to realize how bad it is. Verizon doesn’t have people in the store to help you with problems. Each store you go into may be a different company selling Verizon stuff, not Verizon employees, even though it appears to be a Verizon business. (You notice I said STUFF, because there is no “service”) Their only interest is selling you something.  

And, they lied about my bill. It’s higher than before. If you decide to switch, get the cost in writing. They slip more things in. “Oh yes, if you want the higher WiFi service that’ll match what you had before, that’ll be another $10 a month.” 
On and on. ☹️"

It only happens when I go to the rewards tab, and a large part of why I signed up for Verizon Fios was because of all of the onboarding rewards they were offering.

It also will no longer use Face ID to log into the app. In addition to this many features of the app are very slow or do not load at all: most things in my profile section, the forums, certain options in regard to my bill etc. I don’t know what changed, the app was much better as recently as a few months ago."

Kept calling and bounced from one department to another for about 2 hours. Been told I’ll receive call backs but never did. So when I call them they be putting me on hold. Each time I get a different representative and every one of them promised something and says something completely different than the one before. Told me to go to the store and get a validation so I did but they still gave me problems and holds the next day when I called to finalize the Credit. And again they told to call me back in an hour and they didn’t so I had to call back. Opened more than one ticket and it got accelerated. Didn’t even write everything but overall the service is bad and not reliable at all.

Kept calling and bounced from one department to another for about 2 hours. Been told I’ll receive call backs but never did. So when I call them they be putting me on hold. Each time I get a different representative and every one of them promised something and says something completely different than the one before. Told me to go to the store and get a validation so I did but they still gave me problems and holds the next day when I called to finalize the Credit. And again they told to call me back in an hour and they didn’t so I had to call back. Opened more than one ticket and it got accelerated. Didn’t even write everything but overall the service is bad and not reliable at all.

One used to find all the information needed in a single tab, now one must dig through multiple sub menus just to get the same information. I’m guessing they’ve never heard the phrase “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” Additionally, Verizon has switched to a tier subscription-like model for their phone upgrades where you only get good upgrade promotions by paying for the top tier plan. This is very different compared to before. I will be looking to switch to a different carrier."

Most features and links error out after first click. Cluttered junk—most features are gimmicky with cheap feel. Overseas customer service team with very little English skills.  BOT/Ai driven inaccurate results.   Will not recommend company or products.  Network outage lasted 9 hours.   Took a year, but developers finally fixed face-id on app.  Let’s see what they break next.  Service support cancelled yet bombarded with text and email.  Clown show at Verizon under greed regime.  Service central integration in app is a gimmick and adds confusion to already under trained outsourced workers.  Home internet has separate app, but Verizon manages to cram in mobile which is a cluster of lossless hope!  Zero star app.  I wish it could give a lower rating!!"

I’ve always said if you take care of your people, they will take care of you. Verizon will take your money, offer you discounts that are just what you would have paid had you not switched to the “newest” plan, and leave you on read when you are trying to do it their way.

I’ve always said if you take care of your people, they will take care of you. Verizon will take your money, offer you discounts that are just what you would have paid had you not switched to the “newest” plan, and leave you on read when you are trying to do it their way.

You’ve been warned."

One of the perks for signing up for everything I did was free Disney+ for a year… well I dropped that… because I always had to sign in and verify it was me… it would say on my tv I was in different cities, some I had never even heard of (Assuming that was where my signal was coming from).

Two Verizon reps came to my home and offered me internet service. I told them I currently pay $65/month with AT&T for 50 Mbps. They laughed and said, “Oh man, that’s way too much for such slow speed. We can give you 300 Mbps for $85 – but right now we have a promotion, and you’ll only pay $45. Not just temporarily, but locked in for 4 years!”

That sounded like a great deal, so I signed up. Today I received the equipment, installed it, and when I logged into my account – surprise – the plan was $85, not $45.

I called Verizon immediately thinking it was just a mistake. Instead, the rep told me there was no error, the plan is indeed $85, but they can “generously” give me a $10 discount. What a joke. When I asked if it was normal for their salespeople to blatantly lie and trick customers, the rep hung up on me.

This was nothing but fraud and deception. Verizon’s door-to-door salespeople lied to my face, and customer service didn’t care at all.

I’m writing this review to warn others: stay away from Verizon unless you enjoy being scammed and disrespected."

I can log into the account with my emails, but it isn’t linked to my phone. If I log into the account that has my phone number, I am asked to fill in my info, but holy cow, my email is taken!

- If you claim “make sure to turn on notifications so you don’t have to wait around on your phone for us” for the customer service chat, then new messages should actually SEND a notification! Before anyone asks, yes I verified multiple times that my notifications were on and sound was on. Multiple other app notifications worked just fine

The section of ""Home"" --> ""Verizon Gateway"" is broken today. This part of the aap used to work fine and would show signal strength, options for speed test and for placing the modem in the right spot.
Now this section of the app is broken. Verizon sent me a new modem/gateway and I returned the old modem back to them. Ever since the old modem got returned this section of the app is broken. I spent like 2 hours with their customer service and the customer service is clueless. Verizon's ""my verizon"" app is very unpredictable. So shameful. And now the customer service wants me to try things that have no bearing to the issue. I feel like whoever data entered the return of the old modem into their internal system that person mis entered some data that broke that peace of app for my account. And customer service has no clue and now wants me to wait for 4-5 days. What a joke. Verizon customer service has no clue."

The app constantly logs you out, has a cluttered user interface, and a lame home internet interface that errors out every click with gimmick features. The scrolling tiles displays disorganized functionality.  Can’t tell if on app or internet due to app performing most basic of task on internet.  Might as well use internet vice app. Overseas sourced out customer service is sub par.  Will not recommend nothing from Verizon.

Every single time I want to watch something, I have to spend 15 minutes restarting the box, the app, or both. It’s like Verizon took something simple and reliable and replaced it with the most frustrating, broken system imaginable. The interface is clunky, slow, and unresponsive, and the constant errors make you want to throw the remote at the wall.

I’ve had cable for decades and have never experienced anything this bad. The amount of time wasted just to watch live TV or stream a channel is absurd. Verizon clearly rushed this out without testing it properly, and paying customers are now stuck dealing with their mess.

Do yourself a favor: NEVER get Verizon Fios TV."

Another phone I’m still waiting for two years now for the promotion correction team to reply back with an answer; but after two years and 7 requests still nothing.

You’re stuck. The app doesn’t function properly. It can’t follow troubleshooting steps and would bring back to home screen during troubleshooting. Worst customer service ever.

4219004303,Micuparamedic,2025-06-23T12:18:52-07:00,1,21.0.2,No title can cover how bad this is…,"First, the app itself is slow. There’s delays jumping from page to page. The layout may be intuitive if it actually worked. This would be an amazing app if any part actually worked. The speedtest works intermittently at best. Same for the router reset. Funny thing is, if it can do the speed test, it won’t let you reset the router! At least there’s an option for support. That should give you hope that Verizon is there and they care. Go ahead, click on the call back button. You may want to take an aspirin first. I’ve tried a total of 6 times. The first time, it gave me some hope. They called back immediately… and took me directly to automated purgatory. When asked for my pin, I went into the app to get it but the automated system just hung up. The next time I pressed the button for a callback, no callback after 15 minutes. I press the button again and I’m returned to robotic purgatory. This time I get past the pin. I’m asked if I’m calling about setting up my autopay. After replying no, the soul sucking system decided it wasn’t worth there time if it wasn’t about money so the automated demons hung up again… it took 6 times and eventually I just called myself. Then, 41 minutes later, someone actually came to the line. I can’t tell you yet if they’ve fixed my issue but that is irrelevant to the review of this application atrocity. Consider yourself warned, if you plan on using this application atrocity you may need a punching bag as well."

1. Still lacking a widget, especially one that tacks data usage vs days left. I still don’t know why they got rid of this.

2. The Alapp is still a shell for their website. So the entire experience is slow, buggy with frequent crashes

3. The “My Data Usage” page has turned into a joke. They got rid of the bars/charts that lets you see each members data usage and the number of days left all in one view. You’re now forced to click on each member to see their usages. Worse, the data only shows the total data used not for each individual.


PLEASE!!! Do something about the app. Why does it get worse with each update?????

———————-
Biggest gripe is the widget not showing how many days are left for the data for the month. To check you have to click the widget > wait for it to load the personal data usage > click the account tab on the bottom > click usage. All this for something that should show on the widget in the first place. Also, the app basically being a shell for the webpage really shows when there are constant load times to navigate between each screen, and the complete lack of visual feedback for any interaction (click/touch) with the interface. Two stars are for the simple existence of a widget showing remaining data (PLZ add REMAINING DAYS!!!)"

179311457,khushbot,2025-08-26T14:29:39-07:00,1,21.2.1,Worst Interest!!,"This has been the WORST internet experience of my life. I was a Verizon customer for only about 5–6 months and in that short time, I ended up paying over $1,000 just for Wi-Fi. Every month the bill was outrageous, sometimes $100, sometimes $200, and even $300! That is INSANE for just internet.

When I first signed up, they promised me student discounts and also said my dad’s EBT would qualify for additional discounts. But once I became a member, they didn’t help me at all. I spent hours trying to apply those discounts myself, struggling to lower the bill, but Verizon gave me no support. Before I joined, they told me everything would be fine and they would help. But the moment I became a customer, they just ignored me and kept charging me ridiculous amounts.

I must say the internet speed is good, but paying this much for Wi-Fi is absolutely crazy. Spending $200–$300 a month only on internet is not acceptable when I have other bills to cover. Their customer service is useless, their promises are empty, and the bills are nothing but a trap.

I switched last month because I couldn’t take it anymore. I will NEVER recommend Verizon to anyone. Save yourself the frustration, stress, and money."

- If you claim “make sure to turn on notifications so you don’t have to wait around on your phone for us” for the customer service chat, then new messages should actually SEND a notification! Before anyone asks, yes I verified multiple times that my notifications were on and sound was on. Multiple other app notifications worked just fine
