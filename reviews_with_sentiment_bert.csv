319938458,"Run!. Run run run! Run as fast as you can! I have been with this company for over 25 years and it’s been great, until about 3 years ago. It has been nothing but issue after issue. I don’t remember why but 3 years ago they made me get a new line in order to fix an issue.
My current issue started last year. I lost my phone, it was gone. Issue wanted nearly 400 to replace it, I couldn’t do that at the time. They suggested and talked me into getting a new phone by adding another line to my account. I would pay for both lines for a year, then once my old phone was paid off, I could cancel that line. Current time, beginning of August. I go in to do that,only to find out that they for some reason, they switched the phone numbers and phones. They wanted me to pay off the rest of my current phone in order to remove the added line. Then it was, we will switch your phone number and phones around so that you can close the phone that’s paid off. I’ve been in and out of the store. On the phone with several different agents and different times. I’ve tried to get them to fix it through chat. Still not fixed! 2 months still not fixed. Plus my bill normally is around 200, I was expected around 400 but they took 600 from my account. I go into my Verizon today and they are trying to charge me nearly 400 again this month. And nothing has been fixed on my account. So I got onto my Verizon again…I told them I was giving them one more shot to get it fixed, if they didn’t get in done I was going to AT&T.
After an hour my Verizon stopped working  and I could no longer login to my Verizon and my hotspot no longer worked.

I attempted to go to the box to add my phone number. Again, no keyboard appeared, and there was a message in red letters, telling me that the first four of my social was a required field. Thinking that perhaps my app needed to be updated, I went to the App Store and updated the app. I went back into the email and clicked on the “apply now” button. I was taken to my Verizon app once more with no apparent place to apply for the card. So I located the offer within the app and attempted everything again. Once again, no keyboard.

The moment I turned it on, I realized both cameras didn’t work. Not blurry, not glitchy — just dead. Front and back. On a phone that’s supposed to have one of the best cameras, that’s ridiculous.

When I called, Verizon told me to just send it back and wait for a replacement. Sounds simple, but in reality it means:
	•	Going without a phone right after switching carriers.
	•	Worrying my promo (no-trade-in free phone) might get messed up.
	•	Wasting time on something that should’ve worked straight out of the box.

It’s frustrating because I joined Verizon expecting better. Instead, my first experience is a headache. Apple dropped the ball too — both cameras failing on day one isn’t normal.

179311457,"Worst Interest!!. This has been the WORST internet experience of my life. I was a Verizon customer for only about 5–6 months and in that short time, I ended up paying over $1,000 just for Wi-Fi. Every month the bill was outrageous, sometimes $100, sometimes $200, and even $300! That is INSANE for just internet.

When I first signed up, they promised me student discounts and also said my dad’s EBT would qualify for additional discounts. But once I became a member, they didn’t help me at all. I spent hours trying to apply those discounts myself, struggling to lower the bill, but Verizon gave me no support. Before I joined, they told me everything would be fine and they would help. But the moment I became a customer, they just ignored me and kept charging me ridiculous amounts.

I must say the internet speed is good, but paying this much for Wi-Fi is absolutely crazy. Spending $200–$300 a month only on internet is not acceptable when I have other bills to cover. Their customer service is useless, their promises are empty, and the bills are nothing but a trap.

Two Verizon reps came to my home and offered me internet service. I told them I currently pay $65/month with AT&T for 50 Mbps. They laughed and said, “Oh man, that’s way too much for such slow speed. We can give you 300 Mbps for $85 – but right now we have a promotion, and you’ll only pay $45. Not just temporarily, but locked in for 4 years!”

That sounded like a great deal, so I signed up. Today I received the equipment, installed it, and when I logged into my account – surprise – the plan was $85, not $45.

I called Verizon immediately thinking it was just a mistake. Instead, the rep told me there was no error, the plan is indeed $85, but they can “generously” give me a $10 discount. What a joke. When I asked if it was normal for their salespeople to blatantly lie and trick customers, the rep hung up on me.

127711816,"Bad service all over. Calling any verizon number puts me in a phone loop. Trying to talk to someone, I get hung up on by the system.  It took me a long time of trying anything and everything because my account wasn’t fully set up by the representative to get to another person to talk to, who was someone overseas, that asked me to send them copies of my proof of residence and I.D., as well as asking for all the addresses over and over.  The person that initially set up my account misspelled my name despite me telling it to her and spelling it multiple times, and then I was told that they could not update it, because the account was not finalized. So I was getting flagged for things not being correct, and could not get my phone sent to me. Since I moved, and my state updates address changes in the system, and I don’t have a new I.D., I don’t even have one to take a picture of to send, even if I wanted to. So they won’t ship my phone, and are just sitting on the SIM cards as well, despite me providing them all of the detailed information they were asking for, but it wasn’t enough for them. Trying to get to talk to a helpful person from here doesn’t work. Terrible service and fail app where you can’t even update the incorrect information that they built in when setting up the account in the system. (Not profile name. I mean the account that the person set up incorrectly.) Awful system and terrible customer service.",NEGATIVE,0.9997599720954895

We can give you 300 Mbps for $85 – but right now we have a promotion, and you’ll only pay $45. Not just temporarily, but locked in for 4 years!”

That sounded like a great deal, so I signed up. Today I received the equipment, installed it, and when I logged into my account – surprise – the plan was $85, not $45.

I called Verizon immediately thinking it was just a mistake. Instead, the rep told me there was no error, the plan is indeed $85, but they can “generously” give me a $10 discount. What a joke.

- The UI/UX is terrible. Why do I have to click so deep in to see service information for what I’m paying for? Why are the immediate links to pay for new stuff I don’t want?
- If you claim “make sure to turn on notifications so you don’t have to wait around on your phone for us” for the customer service chat, then new messages should actually SEND a notification! Before anyone asks, yes I verified multiple times that my notifications were on and sound was on. Multiple other app notifications worked just fine

I saw an email that said my bill was changed to $50 but when it came time for autopay they stole money that is not authorized. All this over the past 20 years.

1. Still lacking a widget, especially one that tacks data usage vs days left. I still don’t know why they got rid of this.

2. The Alapp is still a shell for their website. So the entire experience is slow, buggy with frequent crashes

3. The “My Data Usage” page has turned into a joke. They got rid of the bars/charts that lets you see each members data usage and the number of days left all in one view. You’re now forced to click on each member to see their usages. Worse, the data only shows the total data used not for each individual.


PLEASE!!! Do something about the app. Why does it get worse with each update?????

Biggest gripe is the widget not showing how many days are left for the data for the month. To check you have to click the widget > wait for it to load the personal data usage > click the account tab on the bottom > click usage.

179311457,"Worst Interest!!. This has been the WORST internet experience of my life. I was a Verizon customer for only about 5–6 months and in that short time, I ended up paying over $1,000 just for Wi-Fi. Every month the bill was outrageous, sometimes $100, sometimes $200, and even $300! That is INSANE for just internet.

When I first signed up, they promised me student discounts and also said my dad’s EBT would qualify for additional discounts. But once I became a member, they didn’t help me at all. I spent hours trying to apply those discounts myself, struggling to lower the bill, but Verizon gave me no support. Before I joined, they told me everything would be fine and they would help. But the moment I became a customer, they just ignored me and kept charging me ridiculous amounts.

I must say the internet speed is good, but paying this much for Wi-Fi is absolutely crazy. Spending $200–$300 a month only on internet is not acceptable when I have other bills to cover. Their customer service is useless, their promises are empty, and the bills are nothing but a trap.

I switched last month because I couldn’t take it anymore. I will NEVER recommend Verizon to anyone. Save yourself the frustration, stress, and money.",NEGATIVE,0.9995203018188477
