I recently switched to Mint because it‚Äôs way cheaper (for the price of 1 month at Verizon , I can get 3 months at Mint for 2 people) and the connection has been identical. I kept the 5G internet because it works and it‚Äôs a good deal.

Since the switch, I have been faced with nothing but the most vindictive user experience. I lost access to my app account (which is how I pay my bill), I have now been inundated with warnings surrounding getting with the support team to troubleshoot my 5G connectivity. I‚Äôm no fool. They‚Äôve been throttling my connection since I‚Äôve switched carriers and I‚Äôll call it like it is. It‚Äôs dishonest, petty, vindictive, and not a way a business should be practicing.

I‚Äôve always said if you take care of your people, they will take care of you. Verizon will take your money, offer you discounts that are just what you would have paid had you not switched to the ‚Äúnewest‚Äù plan, and leave you on read when you are trying to do it their way.

1. Still lacking a widget, especially one that tacks data usage vs days left. I still don‚Äôt know why they got rid of this.

2. The Alapp is still a shell for their website. So the entire experience is slow, buggy with frequent crashes

3. The ‚ÄúMy Data Usage‚Äù page has turned into a joke. They got rid of the bars/charts that lets you see each members data usage and the number of days left all in one view. You‚Äôre now forced to click on each member to see their usages. Worse, the data only shows the total data used not for each individual.


PLEASE!!! Do something about the app. Why does it get worse with each update?????

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Biggest gripe is the widget not showing how many days are left for the data for the month. To check you have to click the widget > wait for it to load the personal data usage > click the account tab on the bottom > click usage. All this for something that should show on the widget in the first place. Also, the app basically being a shell for the webpage really shows when there are constant load times to navigate between each screen, and the complete lack of visual feedback for any interaction (click/touch) with the interface. Two stars are for the simple existence of a widget showing remaining data (PLZ add REMAINING DAYS!!!)",App improvements needed,General Feedback

I was a Verizon customer for only about 5‚Äì6 months and in that short time, I ended up paying over $1,000 just for Wi-Fi. Every month the bill was outrageous, sometimes $100, sometimes $200, and even $300! That is INSANE for just internet.

When I first signed up, they promised me student discounts and also said my dad‚Äôs EBT would qualify for additional discounts. But once I became a member, they didn‚Äôt help me at all. I spent hours trying to apply those discounts myself, struggling to lower the bill, but Verizon gave me no support. Before I joined, they told me everything would be fine and they would help. But the moment I became a customer, they just ignored me and kept charging me ridiculous amounts.

I must say the internet speed is good, but paying this much for Wi-Fi is absolutely crazy. Spending $200‚Äì$300 a month only on internet is not acceptable when I have other bills to cover. Their customer service is useless, their promises are empty, and the bills are nothing but a trap.

The interface is clunky, slow, and unresponsive, and the constant errors make you want to throw the remote at the wall.

I‚Äôve had cable for decades and have never experienced anything this bad. The amount of time wasted just to watch live TV or stream a channel is absurd. Verizon clearly rushed this out without testing it properly, and paying customers are now stuck dealing with their mess.

1. Still lacking a widget, especially one that tacks data usage vs days left. I still don‚Äôt know why they got rid of this.

2. The Alapp is still a shell for their website. So the entire experience is slow, buggy with frequent crashes

3. The ‚ÄúMy Data Usage‚Äù page has turned into a joke. They got rid of the bars/charts that lets you see each members data usage and the number of days left all in one view. You‚Äôre now forced to click on each member to see their usages. Worse, the data only shows the total data used not for each individual.

Biggest gripe is the widget not showing how many days are left for the data for the month. To check you have to click the widget > wait for it to load the personal data usage > click the account tab on the bottom > click usage. All this for something that should show on the widget in the first place. Also, the app basically being a shell for the webpage really shows when there are constant load times to navigate between each screen, and the complete lack of visual feedback for any interaction (click/touch) with the interface.

200085912,DTW Shak,2025-08-31T22:27:53-07:00,1,21.2.2,My very first Verizon phone showed up broken ‚Äî not a good start,"I‚Äôm new to Verizon. Just signed up and ordered a brand-new iPhone through them. The moment I turned it on, I realized both cameras didn‚Äôt work. Not blurry, not glitchy ‚Äî just dead. Front and back. On a phone that‚Äôs supposed to have one of the best cameras, that‚Äôs ridiculous.

When I called, Verizon told me to just send it back and wait for a replacement. Sounds simple, but in reality it means:
	‚Ä¢	Going without a phone right after switching carriers.
	‚Ä¢	Worrying my promo (no-trade-in free phone) might get messed up.
	‚Ä¢	Wasting time on something that should‚Äôve worked straight out of the box.

It‚Äôs frustrating because I joined Verizon expecting better. Instead, my first experience is a headache. Apple dropped the ball too ‚Äî both cameras failing on day one isn‚Äôt normal.

All I want is a smooth replacement, no risk to my deal, and some acknowledgment that this was a rare but extreme problem. Right now it feels like I‚Äôm just stuck dealing with it on my own, and that‚Äôs not a good look for welcoming a new customer.",Wants smooth replacement,Customer Support
